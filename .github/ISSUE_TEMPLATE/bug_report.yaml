        > 
        > Follow these steps (skip the ones you already have done):
        > - Enable developer options and USB DEBUGGING
        > - Install ADB on your PC
        > - Connect your phone to your PC
        > - Execute this command on PC
        > 
        > ### To enable developer options and USB DEBUGGING
        > 
        > [Follow this article](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
        > In essence you find the build number in About section of settings page and tap it a few times
        > Then open developer options and enable USB DEBUGGING
        > 
        > ### Install ADB on your PC
        > 
        > Download ADB from here [https://adbinstaller.com/](https://adbinstaller.com/)
        > 
        > Unzip it
        > 
        > [(Click here if you wanna know more about ADB)](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb)
        > 
        > ### Connect your phone to your PC
        > 
        > Use a USB cable to connect your phone to your PC
        > 
        > ### Execute this command on PC
        > On windows open Powershell in the directory with the adb.exe (where you unzipped it, if you didn't add it to the PATH)
        > 
        > On Unix open a shell in the directory with the adb (where you unzipped it, if you didn't add it to the PATH)
        > 
        > To test if this is working type `adb devices`, this should output a device
        > 
        > Then execute this command `adb shell logcat --pid $(adb shell "timeout 5s logcat | sed -En 's/.*com.jerboa.*, PID: (\S*)/\1/p'| tail -1")`
        > The above command will print the logs of the latest execution of Jerboa (regardless of which version/build).
        > 
        > That should look like something like this.
